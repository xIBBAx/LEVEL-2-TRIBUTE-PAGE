# LEVEL-2-TRIBUTE-PAGE
I have successfully completed Task two of LEVEL TWO given by #oasisinfobyte using html, CSS and JavaScript. a heartfelt way to honor and remember someone special through the art of web design. A tribute page is a digital dedication, a single web page created to celebrate an individual's life, achievements, or contributions.
